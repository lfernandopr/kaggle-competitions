# My Kaggle Competitions


## Introduction 
This repository contains my solutions for [Kaggle Competitions](http://www.kaggle.com). The objective is to share with other my solutions and to get more hands-on experience on Machine Learning Projects. All solutions are in [Python](https://www.python.org/). The problems are all about Machine Learning and Data Science, I am really passionate about this topics but I am working on developing skills so please feel free to give any recommendations.
